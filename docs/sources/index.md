# üñ• ComCat Lab Welcome Guide üê±

Welcome to the group! This guide introduces several of the key tools and services
that are used in [ComCat Lab][comcat-lab] and examples of their use.

You can view the complete guide in PDF form (comcatlab-welcome-guide.pdf), or,
alternatively, you can [view the guide as a static webpage](dev_guide/docs.md).

The best way to learn is by doing! Start by picking a tutorial and trying to work
through it. The tutorials are (relatively) well documented, though, they are not
self-contained. While you're getting acquainted with the material and workflows,
feel free to bounce back and forth between the tutorials and the software pages.
For more in-depth treatment of the theory, you are encouraged to consult the
"Fundamentals" collection in [ComCat Lab's Zotero collection][zotero-collection].
There you'll find annotated original references, more extensive DFT guides, and relevant
textbooks. Regarding software, the documentation pages are generally extensive. Of course,
if all else fails, don't hesitate to reach out to a group member!
