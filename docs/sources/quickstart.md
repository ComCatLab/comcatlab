# ðŸš€ Quickstart ðŸš€

These instructions assume that you have already completed setup of your SFU
workstation. If you don't have have access to a configured workstation, please out to a
group member to help you set that up, or, if you're feeling up for it, check out
the [local setup repository][local-setup] that will walk you through a comprehensive
setup!

1. Create a virtual environment in the top-level directory of the Welcome Guide folder
(in the same directory as this README).

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```

2. Activate your environment.

    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required Python dependencies.

    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install .
    ```

4. Pick a tutorial!
